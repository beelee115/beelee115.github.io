      <img class="portfolioImage" src="assets/artwork.jpg" alt="A drawing with a bright red backgrond appears with one hand cupped as if it were picking up water. Two blue hands are besides the hand in the middle, one on its left and the other on its right, both holding a brush and pointing it towards the the palm of the middle hand. Lastly, a purple liquid pours towards the palm of the middle hand and a bit of it escapes and falls into an ocean of the purple liquid.">
